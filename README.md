# auction-marketplace
This is a marketplace for auctions.
 
Users can register an item in the marketplace by calling the RegisterItem function which will mint an ERC721 NFT and create an auction for the item. Other users can then bid on this item and the owner will then call the endAuction function which will then facilitate the transfering of the item to the highest bidder.
